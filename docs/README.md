## 🔄 Documentation Generation

Documentation is automatically generated on each release via the GitHub Actions workflow:

```bash
# Generate all documentation locally
npm run docs:generate

# Or run individual steps
npm run docs:api          # Generate API documentation
npm run docs:copy-reports # Copy test reports
npm run docs:index        # Generate documentation index
```

## 🎯 Documentation as Code

This documentation follows the **documentation as code** principle:

- ✅ **Automated Generation** - Generated automatically on each release
- ✅ **Version Controlled** - Committed to repository for full traceability
- ✅ **Always Up-to-Date** - Reflects the exact state of the release
- ✅ **Comprehensive** - Includes API docs, test results, and coverage
- ✅ **Accessible** - Available in release artifacts and GitHub Pages

## 🚀 Release Workflow

The release workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Validation** - Lint and validate code
2. **Testing** - Run unit, integration, and E2E tests
3. **Coverage** - Generate test coverage reports
4. **Documentation** - Generate API docs and copy reports
5. **Verification** - Verify documentation structure
6. **Commit** - Commit documentation to main branch
7. **Attestations** - Generate SBOM and build provenance
8. **Release** - Create GitHub release with all artifacts

## 📊 Coverage Reports

The coverage reports provide detailed insights into test coverage:

- **Line Coverage** - Which lines of code are executed by tests
- **Branch Coverage** - Which code branches are tested
- **Function Coverage** - Which functions are tested
- **Statement Coverage** - Which statements are executed

Target thresholds:
- Lines: ≥80%
- Functions: ≥80%
- Branches: ≥75%
- Statements: ≥80%

## 🎭 E2E Test Reports

Playwright test reports include:

- Test execution results per browser
- Screenshots on failure
- Video recordings on failure
- Network activity logs
- Accessibility scan results (axe-core)

## 🔒 Security

The release includes security attestations:

- **SBOM** - Software Bill of Materials (SPDX format)
- **Build Provenance** - SLSA Level 3 attestations
- **Artifact Verification** - GitHub Attestations API

Verify release artifacts:
```bash
gh attestation verify euparliamentmonitor-v*.zip --owner Hack23
```
