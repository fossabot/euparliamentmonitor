## How to Use

### 1. Clone and Build the MCP Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Hack23/European-Parliament-MCP-Server.git
cd European-Parliament-MCP-Server

# Checkout the implementation branch
git checkout feat/implement-ep-api-integration

# Install and build
npm install
npm run build

# Run tests to verify
npm test
```

### 2. Enable MCP in euparliamentmonitor

The euparliamentmonitor news generator is already configured to use the MCP server:

```bash
# In euparliamentmonitor directory
export EP_MCP_SERVER_PATH="/path/to/European-Parliament-MCP-Server/dist/index.js"
export USE_EP_MCP=true  # This is the default

# Generate news with real EP data
npm run generate-news -- --types=week-ahead --languages=en
```

### 3. Verify Connection

When the MCP server is available, you'll see:

```
🔌 Attempting to connect to European Parliament MCP Server...
✅ MCP client connected successfully
📡 Fetching events from MCP server...
✅ Fetched 5 sessions from MCP
```

If the server is not available, it falls back to placeholder content:

```
⚠️ Could not connect to MCP server: ...
⚠️ Falling back to placeholder content
ℹ️ Using placeholder events
```
