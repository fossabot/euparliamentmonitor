# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

EU Parliament Monitor takes security seriously. This document outlines our
security practices, vulnerability disclosure process, and how to report security
issues.

**Security Architecture**: For comprehensive security implementation details,
see [SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md](SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md).

**ISMS Compliance**: This project follows
[Hack23 ISMS Secure Development Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Secure_Development_Policy.md)
and
[Open Source Policy](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/Open_Source_Policy.md).

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes    |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No     |

**Note**: We strongly recommend always using the latest stable release to
benefit from the most recent security updates.

## Reporting Security Issues

### ⚠️ Please DO NOT Report Security Vulnerabilities Through Public GitHub Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly through
one of the following channels:

### 🔒 Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

1. Navigate to the
   [euparliamentmonitor repository](https://github.com/Hack23/euparliamentmonitor)
2. Click on the **Security** tab
3. In the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click **Advisories**
4. Click **Report a vulnerability** to open the advisory form
5. Fill in the advisory details form with as much information as possible
6. Click **Submit report**

**Benefits of using GitHub Security Advisories**:

- Secure, private disclosure channel
- Automatic CVE assignment (if applicable)
- Coordinated disclosure timeline
- Recognition in security advisory

### 📧 Alternative Method: Email

Send vulnerability reports to:
**[security@hack23.com](mailto:security@hack23.com)**

**For sensitive information, use PGP encryption**:

- PGP Key: Available at
  [https://hack23.com/pgp-key.asc](https://hack23.com/pgp-key.asc)
- Key Fingerprint: (to be added)

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us understand and address the issue quickly, please include:

### Required Information

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, injection, authorization bypass)
- **Affected Component**: Which file, function, or feature is affected
- **Attack Vector**: How can the vulnerability be exploited
- **Impact**: What is the potential security impact
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or commands demonstrating the issue

### Optional But Helpful

- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix the issue
- **Related Issues**: Links to similar vulnerabilities or related security
  concerns
- **CVE References**: If the issue is related to known CVEs
- **CVSS Score**: If you've calculated a severity score

### Example Report Template

```
**Vulnerability Type**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Component**: scripts/article-template.js, line 123

**Attack Vector**: User-controlled data from MCP server is not sanitized before being inserted into HTML.

**Impact**: An attacker with control over MCP server data could inject malicious JavaScript that executes in users' browsers.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Set up malicious MCP server that returns payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
2. Run news generation with: npm run generate-news
3. Open generated article in browser
4. Observe alert dialog

**Proof of Concept**:
[Include code or screenshot]

**Suggested Fix**: Use DOMPurify or implement stricter HTML sanitization in sanitizeUserInput().
```

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security vulnerabilities promptly:

| Phase                   | Timeline                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Initial Response**    | Within 48 hours of report submission       |
| **Validation & Triage** | Within 7 days                              |
| **Fix Development**     | Based on severity (see below)              |
| **Security Advisory**   | Published after fix is deployed            |
| **CVE Assignment**      | If applicable, coordinated with disclosure |

### Fix Timeline by Severity

| Severity     | Description                                  | Fix Timeline |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, authentication bypass | 7 days       |
| **High**     | XSS, injection, significant data exposure    | 14 days      |
| **Medium**   | CSRF, information disclosure, DoS            | 30 days      |
| **Low**      | Minor security improvements                  | 90 days      |

**Note**: Complex fixes may require additional time. We will keep you informed
throughout the process.

## Security Update Process

Once a vulnerability is confirmed, we follow this process:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Validation**: Our security team validates the vulnerability within 7 days
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix according to severity
   timelines
4. **Security Advisory**: We prepare a GitHub Security Advisory (private draft)
5. **Fix Deployment**: We release the fix in a new version
6. **Public Disclosure**: We publish the security advisory and credit the
   reporter
7. **Notification**: We notify users through GitHub releases and security tab

### Example Security Advisory

When we publish a security advisory, it includes:

- **CVE Number**: (if assigned)
- **Severity**: CVSS score and severity level
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are vulnerable
- **Fixed Versions**: Which versions include the fix
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
- **Mitigation**: Steps users can take to protect themselves
- **Credits**: Recognition of the security researcher who reported the issue

npm run test:unit -- --grep="security|xss|injection|sanitize"
```

### Manual Security Testing

Before releases, we conduct:

- Threat model review (see [SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md](SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md))
- Dependency vulnerability assessment
- Code review focusing on security-critical paths
- XSS and injection testing
- Supply chain security verification

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Security Posture

**Classification** (per
[ISMS Classification Framework](https://github.com/Hack23/ISMS-PUBLIC/blob/main/CLASSIFICATION.md)):

- **Confidentiality**: Public (Level 1) - European Parliament open data
- **Integrity**: Medium (Level 2) - News accuracy critical
- **Availability**: Medium (Level 2) - Daily updates expected

**Risk Assessment**:

- **P1 (Medium Risk)**: Data integrity issues if MCP server compromised or
  returns malicious data
  - **Mitigation**: Multi-layer input validation and sanitization
  - **Status**: Additional automated content verification planned (Q3 2026)
- **P2 (Low Risk)**: Supply chain attacks via dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Zero production dependencies, SHA-pinned actions, Dependabot
  - **Status**: Continuously monitored
- **P3-P5 (Low Risk)**: Other threats have robust controls (see
  [SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md](SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md))

### Known False Positives

**ajv ReDoS Vulnerability (GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6)**

- **Status**: False Positive (Not Exploitable) - Upgrade Blocked by Plugin
  Compatibility
- **Affected Package**: ajv < 8.18.0 (transitive dependency via @eslint/eslintrc
  in ESLint 9.x)
- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS: N/A)
- **Description**: ReDoS vulnerability when using `$data` option in ajv schema
  validation
- **Analysis**:
  - ESLint and @eslint/eslintrc do not use the `$data` option in their ajv
    configurations
  - The vulnerability cannot be exploited in our usage context
  - Review of dependency code confirms no use of vulnerable feature
- **Resolution Path**:
  - **ESLint 10 Status**: Released (10.0.0) on 2026-02-17 but still uses ajv 6.x
    internally
  - **Blocker**: ESLint plugins not yet updated for ESLint 10 API changes:
    - `eslint-plugin-security@3.0.1`: Uses deprecated `context.getSourceCode()`
      API
    - `eslint-plugin-sonarjs@3.0.7`: Peer dependency limited to
      `^8.0.0 || ^9.0.0`
    - `eslint-plugin-jsdoc@62.5.5`: Peer dependency limited to
      `^7.0.0 || ^8.0.0 || ^9.0.0`
  - **Action Required**: Monitor plugin updates for ESLint 10 compatibility
  - **Timeline**: Expected Q2-Q3 2026 as plugin ecosystem catches up
- **Monitoring**:
  - Track plugin releases monthly
  - Test ESLint 10 compatibility when plugins release updates
  - Re-evaluated 2026-02-17
- **Risk Level**: Accepted (No exploitable attack vector in current
  implementation)
- **Last Reviewed**: 2026-02-17

### Limitations

As a static site generator:

- No runtime authentication/authorization mechanisms
- Content integrity depends on MCP server trustworthiness
- Limited real-time threat detection (relies on GitHub security features)
