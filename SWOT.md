### W1: MCP Server Development Dependency

**Description**: European Parliament MCP Server still in development, limiting
real-time data access.

**Business Impact**:

- Reduced article quality (placeholder content)
- Limited data freshness (stale information)
- User trust concerns (accuracy questions)
- Competitive disadvantage (vs. real-time platforms)

**Current State**:

- Skeleton MCP server implementation
- Fallback mode with placeholder content
- `USE_EP_MCP=false` environment variable
- Manual testing required

**Mitigation Strategy**:

1. **Short-term**: Improve placeholder content quality
2. **Medium-term**: Prioritize MCP server development
3. **Long-term**: Explore alternative data sources (backup APIs)

**Resource Requirements**:

- Development time: 40-80 hours

## ⚡ Threats

External challenges and risks that could negatively impact the platform.

### T1: LLM Reliability and Hallucination

**Description**: Risk of AI-generated misinformation, factual errors, and
hallucinations in content.

**Threat Analysis**:

- **Probability**: Medium (LLMs inherently probabilistic)
- **Impact**: High (reputation damage, user trust loss)
- **Velocity**: Fast (single error can go viral)
- **Detectability**: Moderate (requires validation)

**Manifestations**:

- Fabricated quotes from MEPs
- Incorrect vote tallies or dates
- Misattributed statements
- Logical inconsistencies
- Outdated information presented as current

**Risk Scenarios**: | Scenario | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|------------|--------|------------| | **Minor Factual Error** | High
| Low | Correction notice, update | | **Major Misinformation** | Low | High |
Immediate takedown, investigation | | **Systematic Bias** | Medium | Medium |
Model retraining, prompt tuning | | **Hallucinated Event** | Low | Very High |
Enhanced fact-checking, source verification |

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Prevention**:
   - Strong source validation (schema enforcement)
   - Conservative prompts (fact-focused, not creative)
   - Temperature tuning (lower randomness)
   - Citation requirements (all claims sourced)

2. **Detection**:
   - Automated fact-checking (secondary LLM review)
   - Source cross-reference (verify against EP APIs)
   - Community reporting (user feedback mechanism)
   - Periodic audits (manual review sample)

3. **Response**:
   - Immediate takedown procedure
   - Correction notice publication
   - Root cause analysis
   - Process improvement

**Monitoring KPIs**:

- Error rate: <1% of articles
- Detection time: <24 hours
- Correction time: <2 hours
- User reports: <0.1% of views

**Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium-High (manageable but serious)

---

### T2: European Parliament API Changes

**Description**: Breaking changes to EP APIs, deprecations, or service
discontinuation.

**Threat Analysis**:

- **Probability**: Medium (APIs evolve)
- **Impact**: High (service disruption)
- **Velocity**: Varies (depends on notice period)
- **Detectability**: High (usually announced)

**Change Types**: | Change Type | Impact | Typical Notice | Mitigation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|------------| | **Minor Version
Update** | Low | 1-3 months | Version locking, testing | | **Major Version
Update** | Medium | 6-12 months | Migration planning, dual support | |
**Deprecation** | High | 12-24 months | Alternative source, redesign | |
**Schema Change** | Medium | 3-6 months | Schema validation updates | | **Rate
Limit Change** | Low | 1-3 months | Request throttling |

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Proactive Monitoring**:
   - Subscribe to EP developer updates
   - Monitor GitHub issues/announcements
   - Participate in developer community
   - Test beta APIs early

2. **Defensive Design**:
   - Version lock API calls
   - Implement adapter pattern (abstraction layer)
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Fallback data sources

3. **Contingency Planning**:
   - Multi-source data strategy (not single API)
   - Cached historical data (continuity)
   - Manual data entry process (emergency)
   - Community data contributions

**Historical Precedent**:

- European Parliament APIs are relatively stable
- Deprecations typically have long notice periods
- EU Open Data Portal provides alternative sources
- MCP abstraction layer reduces direct dependency

**Risk Level**: 🟡 Medium (predictable risk)
